# A-hybrid-framework-for-imbalanced-classification
This is a program of a new hybrid framework to solve the highly imbalanced classification proposed by Min Qian and Yanfu Li.

In this program, Graph semisupervised SMOTE is developed and applied to improve the credibility of synthetic samplesâ€™ labels. At the same time, to better solve multi-dimensional problems and highly imbalanced problems in class imbalance, we introduced cost-sensitive neighborhood components analysis (CS-NCA) for dimensionality reduction and bootstrap based ensemble framework (BEF) for reducing imbalanced ratio.

The experimental results show the proposed method is a good choice for highly imbalanced and high dimensional data classification.
